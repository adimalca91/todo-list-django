<h3> Task Form </h3>

<!-- Send the form to the same url, therefore action is empty string -->
<!--
    Note: Django already created the ModelForm and it passes it in, and by default the form name
    is already 'form'
-->
<form action="" method="POST"> 
    {% csrf_token %}

    {{form.as_p}}

    <input type="submit" value="Submit">

</form>
